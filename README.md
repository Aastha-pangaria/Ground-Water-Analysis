# Ground-Water-Analysis

This project was mainly a learning journey for me to get comfortable with data science concepts and machine learning, especially applied to real-world environmental data. I worked with actual groundwater quality data to understand how to clean and prepare the data, calculate the Water Quality Index based on official standards, and build models to predict important contaminants like Fluoride, Arsenic, and Nitrate. Along the way, I learned how to evaluate these models properly and how to interpret which features or factors influence the water quality the most. It was a great way to connect theory with practice and see how data science can help in understanding and protecting our environment.

Besides building technical skills, I also focused on writing clear, reusable code that others can easily follow and adapt. The visualizations and comparisons between different models helped me grasp their strengths and weaknesses, and gave me insight into what affects groundwater quality. While the main goal was to learn and experiment, I hope this project can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone interested in water quality analysis or environmental data science. Itâ€™s a small step towards using data to make better decisions about our natural resources.
